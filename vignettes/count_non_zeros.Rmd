```{r setup}
library(visian)

```

Data often requires some pre-processing in order to determine that your data is clean. The visian package provides this functionality. Currently, it features just one function - `countNonZero()` - allowing a clean base-R function to interpret data and models.

```{r example}
countNonZero(seq(0,5))
```
